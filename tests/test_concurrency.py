"""Real concurrency, not sequential calls that merely look concurrent.

test_timing.py's ``test_only_one_session_may_be_open_per_employee`` calls
``start_session`` twice in a row on the same connection — by the second call
the first session's row is already visible, so the ``select_for_update()``
guard has something to lock. It does not prove anything about two requests
that arrive at the same instant, before either row exists.

These tests use real OS threads, each on its own database connection, to
reproduce what 100+ people clicking "Start work" across a shift actually
looks like. They need ``transaction=True`` — the plain ``db`` fixture wraps
the test in one uncommitted transaction, which a second thread's connection
cannot see into (and select_for_update from a second thread on the same
un-committed transaction would just hang).
